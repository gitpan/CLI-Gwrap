CLI::Gwrap
----------

A general purpose Graphical User Interface (GUI) wrapper for command line
programs.

Installation:

    tar xvzf CLI-Gwrap-<ver>.tgz
    cd CLI-Gwrap
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

See the example wrapper for the 'ls' directory listing command in

    CLI-Gwrap/bin/gwrap_ls.pl

The example is long, but only because 'ls' has zillions of options.  To run
the example before 'make install', use:

    perl -I lib bin/gwrap_ls.pl

from the CLI-Gwrap directory.
